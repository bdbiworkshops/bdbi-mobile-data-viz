# bdbi-mobile-data-viz
Build Hikify, a statistical step tracker on your phone! We'll use React Native for our frontend, expo-sensors to read mobile accelerometers and react-native-gifted-charts to create the visuals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun) installed.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    We recommend using `npx expo install` for third-party libraries within an Expo project, as it ensures compatible versions.

    yarn install
    ```
