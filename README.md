# bdbi-mobile-data-viz
Build Hikify, a statistical step tracker on your phone! We'll use React Native for our frontend, expo-sensors to read mobile accelerometers and react-native-gifted-charts to create the visuals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Laptop:
    - Install Visual Studio Code (or your IDE of choice!)
    - Install Node.js and npm.
- Mobile Device:
    - Install the Expo Go app (on App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com
    cd your-project-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    We recommend using `npx expo install` for third-party libraries within an Expo project, as it ensures compatible versions.
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install
    # Or using yarn
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm
npx expo start
# Or using yarn
yarn expo start
